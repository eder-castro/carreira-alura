A2FII3I2MBMUIA,B007WTAJTO,1K3,it works as expected. I should have sprung for the higher capacity.  I think its made a bit cheesier than the earlier versions; the paint looks not as clean as before,1356220800,23/12/2012,715,0,0
A3H99DFEG68SR,B007WTAJTO,1m2,"This think has worked out great.Had a diff. bran 64gb card and if went south after 3 months.This one has held up pretty well since I had my S3, now on my Note3.*** update 3/21/14I've had this for a few months and have had ZERO issue's since it was transferred from my S3 to my Note3 and into a note2.

A375ZM4U047O79,B007WTAJTO,2&amp;1/2Men,"Bought it with Retail Packaging, arrived legit, in a orange envelope, english version not asian like the picture shows. arrived quickly, bought a 32 and 16 both retail packaging for my htc one sv and Lg Optimus, both cards in working order, probably best price you'll get for a nice sd card",1373673600,13/07/2013,513,0,0
A2IDCSC6NVONIZ,B007WTAJTO,2Cents!,It's mini storage.  It doesn't do anything else and it's not supposed to.  I purchased it to add additional storage to my Microsoft Surface Pro tablet which only come in 64 and 128 GB.  It does what it's supposed to and SanDisk has a long standing reputation that speaks for itself.,1367193600,29/04/2013,588,0,0
A26YHXZD5UFPVQ,B007WTAJTO,2K1Toaster,I have it in my phone and it never skips a beat. File transfers are speedy and have not had any corruption issues or memory fade issues as I would expect from the Sandisk brand. Great card to own. Why entrust your precious files to a slightly cheaper piece of crap? If you lose everything can you forgive yourself for not spending the extra couple bucks on a trusted product that goes through good QA?,1382140800,19/10/2013,415,0,0
A2Q3ICGWZLY3JJ,B007WTAJTO,98020,"It works, but file writes are a bit slower than expected on a USB3 reader.Also, both reads and writes are FASTER with the card inside the standard-size SD adapter (15 MB/s vs 10 write; 45 MB/s vs 22 MB/s read) on the same card reader.  Can't figure why...",1384905600,20/11/2013,383,0,0

A1FKE13D77L3Y3,B007WTAJTO,Abraham Arturo Meza Marin,"I bougth this micro SD card after some trubles with other that i got from Kingston, i can tell that SanDisk is other quality, this is the best, my i9300 phone can read a 64GB very fast, the dta transfer speed from my pc to my is amazing, if you are looking for additional storage to you phone, for music, pictures and other type of files, this is for you.Pros-Very good quality materials of construction-Amazing speedUpdate after one year this memory is damaged I can not delete or put new files on it, I can not format this memory, I tried to format with my phone, with my pc, with a camera and nothing, now this is like a 64gb cd, the data in the memory is only available to read but I can not move, or delete it, I bought this memory to be used to backup all my data of my android device but now is only a readable memory I can not write data on it any more, I hope sandisk make a better products in the future!!!

A3RV1L35IPTV61,B007WTAJTO,abushaheed,"more like 8mb/s in my Note 10.1 and that's using SanDisk's own app. A bit faster in my Note II, but still a disappointment for devices with quad core processors. Not sure if it's the card or the device, so benefit of the doubt and four stars.",1357430400,01/06/2013,555,0,0
A2RJ7DAL63MN1F,B007WTAJTO,Ace of Sevens,"I used this for a few months in my phone, then it decided to quit mounting. I lost some pictures of pets who died shortly after. I got a replacement card, but I had to send in the old one, giving up any chance of recovering its contents. The new one's worked fine, but failing after 3 months in inexcusable.",1391126400,31/01/2014,311,0,0
A3IJIFZ5HH819V,B007WTAJTO,A. Cho,"everything about it was great, except for the adapter.  It was to tight i had to use a tool to take it back out of the adapter causing me to chip it. so my fault i guess, but i also bought a 16gb version and the adapter for that one was fine.",1373414400,07/10/2013,427,0,0
A1R0JMNRV7HVQM,B007WTAJTO,ACZ,"Used in my phone it's plenty fast and works just like it should. Unexpectedly comes with mini and full SD card size adapters, which is nice. &#34;Fool-proof&#34; packaging or whatever it was, that was laughable. Packaging was decent it just shouldn't have bragged about being impossible to mess up when I messed it up.",1383609600,11/05/2013,576,0,0
APAEBFIM1588A,B007WTAJTO,"Adam Wright ""Electrical Engineer""","This card advertises itself as UHS1 but it's actually UHS50.This means that it will not go up to SDR104 speeds/throughput.Not necessary bad, just false advertising.",1378684800,09/09/2013,455,1,1
A1JOXGZH55JMHW,B007WTAJTO,A.

A1N7LGUPJWWQS9,B007WTAJTO,A.J. Matheson,"I got this because I just couldn't pass up the deal, $17.99. It has been incredibly fast in my HTC Sensation 4g. Pictures are taken and saved instantaneously. Only had it a few days, but have been very happy. Shipping was fast and the packaging was easy to open which is always great in my book. Only issue I had was I had to format it on my computer first before my phone was able to recognize it.",1353888000,26/11/2012,742,0,0
A28CTDM7OP0RAR,B007WTAJTO,Alan,"It works but the actual R/W speeds are 18/8 MB/s, not even Class 10. It should be marketed as ""Sandisk Basic"", not Sandisk Ultra"", unless they mean ultra slow. Now is 2014 and there is no excuse for such slow card from Sandisk.*** UPDATE ***I have redone the test with NotePro 12.2"" instead of using non UHS-I PC and the latest results are 32/8.6MB/s. Since the read speed hits 30, I believe the device is DHS-I ready. Still underwhelmed by the write speed though.",1395705600,25/03/2014,258,0,0
